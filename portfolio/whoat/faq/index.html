						<dt>What is in it for me? Why should I use Who&#64;?</dt>
							<dd>Who&#64; was built for any situation where a relationship makes a difference. Who@ is a big fan of public social media networking sites, yet often times our customers tell us they want to network privately where their competitors, customers, peers or employers can’t see their every move or action. Plus, the most valuable contacts we have are in our phones, not necessarily online where we accepted a friend or link request from someone we don’t really know.</dd>

						<dt>Can I utilize Who@ on my desktop browser? </dt>
							<dd>Yes. We’re not just a mobile app, but a full platform via web, mobile, CRM and other channels. Download our bookmarklet and drag and drop the Who@ logo to your browser. Once logged in, you can highlight any term on the internet and click on that bookmarklet and let the magic begin.</dd>

						<dt>Is Who@ a free service? How do you make money?</dt>
							<dd>Who@ is a freemium service. Each account that is established by synching your contacts gets 5 free accepted intro requests a month on a use it or lose it basis. If a request is declined, that does not count towards your 5. If 10 people accept 1 request of yours, that only counts as 1 request. Should you want more than 5 free accepted intro requests a month, then you can upgrade to a monthly or annual premium subscription. Company discounts are available. Inquire via support@whoat.net</dd>

						<dt>Does Who@ support any other devices other than Apple?</dt>
							<dd>We will have the ability for you to bring in your contacts from other email services such as Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo in January so anyone can use Who@. At this time the only mobile devices we support are Apple iOS devices. Expect Android shortly.</dd>
					</dl>

					<dl id="dl-protecting">
						<dt>What happens to my data once I’ve synced my contacts?</dt>
							<dd>Your information is stored safely and securely in your personal vault in Who@’s systems. All communication is sent via SSL encryption and everything is confidential. You own your data and it will not be released to anyone, unless a mob of lawyers compel us to give something up for legal reasons.</dd>

						<dt>Which contacts are uploaded and which are not?</dt>
							<dd>We only store: First Name, Last Name, Title, Company, Email Address, Phone Numbers, Physical Addresses, Date Contact is created, and Date Contact file is last modified. We store no additional information, including any personal notes attached to contacts. We store sensitive data there too in our own phones and don’t want to synch that either.</dd>

						<dt>Do I own my data? How can I get my data removed from Who&#64;?</dt>
							<dd>Yes. Your data is completely your data and owned by you. In fact, unlike most sites, if you want to cancel your Who&#64; subscription and delete your data, send a delete contacts request with your user ID to support&#64;whoat.net and we’ll comply with your request, pronto.</dd>

						<dt>Do you sell my data?</dt>
							<dd>Nope. Absolutely not. Your data is your data. We are not advertising driven and have zero incentive to sell your data. Our brand promise is Trust and selling your data would break our core promise to you.</dd>

						<dt>What data is searchable and who can search on the data?</dt>
							<dd>First of all, since our brand promise is trust, no random person can ever search on your contacts, or you on theirs. You can only search on your “affiliate network.” That means you must have an affiliation with that person because you work in the same company, or you’ve friended accounts on Who&#64; or you both have opted into a common group. Additionally, the only items ever shared are the: name, title and company that person works for + which type relationship source (company, friend or which group) the contact owner is in their affiliate network. Nothing else. The requestor can make an introduction request. They don’t see any contact information for the target nor the ID of the contact owner (also called the “facilitator”), only that they might obtain an intro from the contact owner if the contact owner accepts the intro request. If the request is declined, the contact owner’s ID is not revealed to protect their identity.</dd>

						<dt>I have all kinds of personal contact in my phone, can anyone see those?</dt>
							<dd>In order for a contact in your phone to become a contact in Who@, it has to have a first and last name, + either a phone # or an mail address. If the only info you have is an 800# for a contact and no email, then that contact isn’t created in Who@. So if you have a contact that just says “Mom” it is not created.</dd>

						<dt>Can I hide any specific contacts so they don’t even show up on any searches?</dt>
							<dd>Yes, swipe a name that shows up in search results and that contact will be greyed out. It won’t show up until you swipe it again and it returns to its normal state.</dd>
					</dl>

					<dl id="dl-search">
						<dt>When I hit Enter after typing a term in the search bar, what does Who@ search on?</dt>
							<dd>We call it your “affiliate network.” The contacts you search on are only from your company, groups you’ve opted into or other Who@ members where you’ve friended their account and they’ve accepted. If you have no affiliation with another member, you can’t search on their contacts or vice versa. Unlike other public social media sites, you don’t have access to all other members.</dd>

						<dt>How do I search for specific area codes?</dt>
							<dd>Simply type in your desired search request and add the numerical area code. For example, if you are looking for a CEO in the New York area, you would type “CEO 212” and all the CEOs from New York that are in your network should pop up.</dd>

						<dt>What do all the icons mean next to names that appear in search?</dt>
							<dd>There are 4:

							<p>The top left icon is a phone, symbolizing the contact is already in your personal address book. If you click on someone that has the phone selected, then you will be able to see the contact details you have for that person, right there on Who@.</p>

							<p>The tie icon in the bottom left symbolizes that somebody in your company knows that person.</p>

							<p>The top right icon, two glasses clinking together, shows that you are friends with this person in the app.</p>

							<p>The bottom right icon of a connector shows that you are in a group with this contact. You may be a member of many groups and when you click on the intro request, you’ll know which group has that contact in their phone.</p></dd>

						<dt>When I search a name, more than one option for that person shows up. What does that mean?</dt>
							<dd>That means that more than one person in your network has that contact, possibly with different emails, phone numbers or companies. On a future update, the server will base all of the contacts and combine ones that are the same. For now, it appears just like it does in each one of your connections’ address book.  A name/company/title/organization that I’m trying to search isn’t showing up. This means that no one in your network knows anyone affiliated with the options you’ve typed in. Encourage your co-workers and friends to sign up so that you can expand your potential introductions.</dd>

						<dt>Will people know who I have searched?</dt>
							<dd>No. Who you look up is private and stored in your account. If you want to view a history of your searched terms, go to Recents on the navigation bar.</dd>

						<dt>Can I import my contacts from Facebook, Linkedin, Instagram, Twitter or other sites?</dt>
							<dd>No. There are plenty of sites that allow you to do that. Those are public networking sites and Who@ is building something entirely different.</dd>
					</dl>

					<dl id="dl-incoming">
						<dt>What does “Incoming” mean?</dt>
							<dd>You have incoming intro requests that need to be answered. Once you have viewed the request, it will be marked as “read” and the orange circle next to the request will turn gray. The faster you respond yes or no, the better you’ll be making the Who@ service, after all, you want someone to answer immediately to your request so as a professional courtesy do the same for them.</dd>

						<dt>I accepted a request. Will the requester be able to see phone # and email?</dt>
							<dd>No, Who@ never shares the contact data, that is up to you. Always.</dd>

						<dt>I declined a request. Will the requester be able to see that I sent it?</dt>
							<dd>No, you remain completely anonymous if you decide to decline a request. The requester will simply be told that they have a declined request by an unknown source.</dd>
					</dl>

					<dl id="dl-requests">
						<dt>What does the circled number next to “My Requests” mean?</dt>
							<dd>You have that many intro requests with answers. Go ahead and get started with your introductions!</dd>

						<dt>If I send a request, will the contact owner see that it is me requesting the introduction?</dt>
							<dd>Yes. That is how the contact owner determines if they are willing to assist in making the introduction. If they accept, you’ll see who has offered to help. However, if they deny you the request, they’ll remain anonymous unless they type their name into the text box when declining your intro request.</dd>

						<dt>If I don’t want to send a request to anyone in my company, how can I change that?</dt>
							<dd>Click on the tie icon on the Create Request screen and it will unselect everyone in your company, and affiliated companies, as the recipients of the request. If only the tie is highlighted, that means that is the only relationship source available.</dd>

						<dt>What does the handshake mean when it turns blue?</dt>
							<dd>The blue handshake means that you have a request detail waiting to be reviewed. Your request has been answered, whether you received an accept or decline.</dd>

						<dt>What happens when I click on the Request Detail</dt>
							<dd>Once an intro request has been accepted, you may click on the “Accepted” info box from the facilitator and contact them directly from there. </dd>

						<dt>The blue handshake lit up and the request detail page has told me I have an accepted request, and yet there is no check.</dt>
							<dd>Your request is not yet complete. If you look on the right side of the screen on your request under the four icons, a status will be posted. It will either say “Completed” or “Pending”. Your status is still pending if you do not have a check yet. This means the request has yet to be answered by another person in your network.</dd>

						<dt>Can I delete a request before it is sent to the contact owner?</dt>
							<dd>You may delete a request, but whether or not the contact owner sees the request is completely dependent on how long it takes you to delete the request and if they see it right after you send it. Though the app will remove it, the facilitator will still get the email. Regardless, if you delete a request, it will be deleted from their incoming queue.</dd>
